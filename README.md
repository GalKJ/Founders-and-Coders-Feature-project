# Founders-and-Coders-Feature-project

## Etch-a-sketch feature for Founders and Coders application

### Planning

Coming from a theatrical background I've always loved interaction with an audience/user and sensory effects that affect the audience/user and add to their experience. Once I'd got a little HTML and CSS under my belt it wasn't long before I started to play around with different graphics, animations and effects.

The Etch-a-sketch feature was an early step of mine to begin to investigate the Canvas API. I have been studying the begginer javascript course by Wes Bos and one of the videos introduces students to Canvas. The concept seemed interesting to me since it would allow me to create interactive graphics on the screen, something i enjoy very much since it's engaging and creative for the user.

I looked into vanilla javascript 3d animations such as this one `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWXgyTldjps` although i felt the explanation wasn't clear enough and there was a real chance of me getting into the pattern of just copying what Navid was doing.

This `https://codepen.io/franksLaboratory/pens/popular` also caught my eye but again i felt that to grasp the basics of the Canvas API I should start with the Wes Bos canvas tutorial since I had access to Wes's course github repo and his instruction is very clear and detailed.
