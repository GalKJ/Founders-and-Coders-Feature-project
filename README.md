# Founders-and-Coders-Feature-project

## Etch-a-sketch feature for Founders and Coders application 

The Etch-a-sketch feature was an early step of mine to begin to investigate the Canvas API. I have been studying the begginer javascript course by Wes Bos and one of the videos introduces students to Canvas. The concept seemed interesting to me since it would allow me to create graphics on the screen, something i enjoy very much since it's interactive and creative for the user.
